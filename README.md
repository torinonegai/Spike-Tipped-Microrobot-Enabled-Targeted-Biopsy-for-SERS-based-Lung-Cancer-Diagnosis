## Requirements
The code has been tested with the following versions of software dependencies:

- **Python**: 3.10.12
- **PyTorch**: 2.4.0
- **NumPy**: 1.26.4
- **Matplotlib**: 3.9.0
- **Scikit-learn**: 1.5.0
- **Captum**: 0.7.0 *(used for model attribution analysis)*
## Run this code
* To quickly test the model with provided test data, simply run the `test.py`.
* For training the model and conducting attribution analysis, 
run the training process with `main.py` and perform attribution analysis with `attibution.py`
